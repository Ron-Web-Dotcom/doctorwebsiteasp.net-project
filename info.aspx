    <div class="container text-center">
<p>Some surgeries are too complex to be done safely in a doctor’s office but simple enough that patients generally do not require hospital care after undergoing them. Ambulatory surgical centers are designed to provide these types of procedures. Also referred to as outpatient or same day surgery centers, these facilities offer a safe environment for the surgery and basic monitoring during the initial post-operation hours. Ambulatory surgical centers are often a less expensive option than a hospital.</p>

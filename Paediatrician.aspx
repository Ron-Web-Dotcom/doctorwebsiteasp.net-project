The pediatricians of Portmore Medical Center in Portmore St. Catherine practice with attention to the physical and emotional needs of children and their families. They work closely with other medical professionals involved in your child's care. 
Children are a parent's most precious gift. At times they may become ill and require hospitalization. No doubt this can be a very stressful and frightening time in your lives. The pediatric department at Portmore Medical Center offers a caring, warm environment that encourages the participation of parents in the health care of their children.
PMC’s dedicated 6-bed pediatric department is staffed by a caring team of pediatric physicians and nurses who specialize in the care of children and use the most advanced technology available to ensure a calm, healing environment. To facilitate the comfort and healing of your child, we offer sleeping chairs in each room for parents to continue to be with their child during overnight stays. The pediatric department is located inside the maternal child department on the main floor. For you and your child's safety, our unit is a protected area that will require patients and visitors to request access upon entering and exiting the unit.

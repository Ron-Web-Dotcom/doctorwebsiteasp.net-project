 <p>PMC nursing home is designed for patients who require constant care but do not need to be hospitalized and cannot be cared for at home. Often associated with seniors who require custodial care in a residential facility, it can actually serve patients of all ages who require this level of care. Nursing homes have medical personal onsite 24 hours a day. A physician, skilled nurses and therapists are on staff to oversee and provide medical care, assistance with medications, and services like physical, speech and occupational therapy. In addition, the nursing home’s staff offers help with basic tasks that can be challenging for individuals with health issues, including feeding, bathing and dressing.</p>

          <p>We understand that a successful surgery begins well before you enter the operating room and continues after you have been discharged and are at home recovering from the procedure. 
       With this in mind, our physicians consult with patients and their families before surgery to truly understanding what is expected from the procedure. 
       A registered nurse is on hand to manage the patient’s care in the office and to help develop a patient-care plan. 
       This plan helps keep everyone well-informed at every step in the process.</p>

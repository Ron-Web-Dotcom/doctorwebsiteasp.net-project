                     <p>Portmore Medical Center offers breast augmentation surgery for reconstructive purposes after breast cancer surgery (for example), to correct a breast defect, to increase breast size, or to achieve a younger, more natural appearance.PMC’s plastic surgeons and surgical team will thoroughly answer your questions, address any concerns or apprehension you may have, and help you decide if breast augmentation surgery is right for you. </p>
                     <p>Breast reduction surgery</p>
                     <p>Portmore Medical Center offers breast reduction surgery to decrease breast size and lift the breasts.

                      <h3>Colon and Rectal Surgery</h3>
                     <p>Our surgeons offer advanced surgical and minimally invasive (laparoscopic) options. In fact, PMC’s colorectal surgeons are among the area’s most successful providers of laparoscopic procedures. These minimally invasive options not only treat disease, they also require a smaller incision (which improves cosmetic results), help preserve normal bowel function, reduce post-operative pain and the need for analgesic medication, and speed recovery. Not all patients are candidates for laparoscopic or other minimally invasive forms of surgery. You and your surgeon will be able to determine the most appropriate treatment options for your particular condition.</p>

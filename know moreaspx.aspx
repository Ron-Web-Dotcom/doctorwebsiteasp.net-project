<h4>Infections</h4>
 <p>A human with an infection has another organism inside them which gets its sustenance (nourishment) from that person, it colonizes that person and reproduces inside them. The human with that organism (germ) inside is called the host, while the germ or pathogen is referred to as a parasitic organism. Another name for an organism that causes infection is an infectious agent.
It is only an infection if the colonization harms the host. It uses the host to feed on and multiply at the expense of the host to such an extent that his/her health is affected. The normal growth of the bacterial flora in the intestine is not an infection, because the bacteria are not harming the host.</p>
<h4>Vaccination</h4>
<p>Vaccinations protect you from specific diseases that can make you very sick, disable or even kill you. They boost your body's own defence system, which is also called the immune system.
Vaccines create immunity that protects you from an infection without causing the suffering of the disease itself.  Sometimes vaccines are called immunizations, needles or shots.</p>
 <h4>Sleep disorders</h4>
 <p>A sleep disorder, or somnipathy, is a medical disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Some sleep disorders are serious enough to interfere with normal physical, mental, social and emotional functioning. Polysomnography and actigraphy are tests commonly ordered for some sleep disorders.</p>
<h4>Contraception</h4>
 <p>A woman can get pregnant if a man's sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova).
Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart, or by stopping egg production, or by stopping the combined sperm and egg (fertilised egg) attaching to the lining of the womb.</p>
 <h4>Sexually transmitted diseases</h4>
 <p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that are mostly (or exclusively) spread through sexual contact, meaning contact between two mucous membranes (through the penis, vagina, anus or mouth) or through vaginal lubrication, (menstrual) blood, sperm, pre-ejaculate or infected bodily fluids (pus).</p

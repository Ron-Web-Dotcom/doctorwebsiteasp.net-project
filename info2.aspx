   <p>At PMC When patients are unable to get to their doctor’s office or want basic medical care without an appointment, an urgent care clinic might be the perfect choice. Sometimes called walk-in clinics, these facilities offer outpatient care immediately. However, it is important to note that an urgent care clinic is not the same as a hospital’s emergency room. If the issue is something that you would normally see your doctor for like a stomach virus or a sprained ankle, then an urgent care clinic is appropriate. If you have a complex health situation or your issue is a true medical emergency like chest pain, breathing difficulties, broken bones or an extremely high fever, then you should head to the hospital’s emergency room without delay.</p>
